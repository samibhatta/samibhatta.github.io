about 

My name is Samikchhya Bhatta and I am originally from Nepal. I moved to United States 8 years ago. Before moving to
United States I worked for e-commerce site myshopasia.com and wholesalepashmina.com. That's how I got more interested in
the field of web development. When I moved to US, I enrolled into Associates in Computer Science and later into 
bachelars in Digital Information Technology where I graduated with honors. Currently, I work as a freelancer and
volunteer web developer for various organization across United States and Nepal.
